# What is Quasar?

The name "Quasar" refers to the celestial body of the same name that radiates from the center of galaxies and absorbs an immense amount of matter.

Quasar aims to provide a simple and understandable interface for developers to create and maintain **data projections** from **Eloquent models** easily.

## What can it do?

One of the typical use cases solved by Laravel Quasar is the creation and maintenance of statistical data represented as **time series**.

Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you create or query data projections, Quasar will provide you with the tools to develop and maintain them and ultimately save you time.

## What are the prerequisites?

Your project must be based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com) (version 8 or above), you must be comfortable with the framework and especially [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent).

## How to get started?

If you want to discover the library quickly, we advise you to follow the [Quickstart section](/docs/quickstart).

If you are already familiar with the library, the Getting Started section will guide you through the use of the tool.
