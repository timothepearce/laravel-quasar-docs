# What is Quasar?

:::info

Laravel Quasar is in pre-release, feel free to star or contribute if you find interest in this project!

:::

Laravel Quasar aims to provide a simple and understandable interface for developers to create and maintain **data projections** from **Eloquent models** easily.

The name "Quasar" refers to the celestial body of the same name that radiates from the center of galaxies, absorbs an immense amount of matter and distorts the space-time. Well, consider it as a metaphor of what it can do ðŸ˜„!

## What problem does it solve?

âœ¨ One of the typical use cases solved by Laravel Quasar is the creation and maintenance of statistical data represented as **time series** (aka your statistic dashboard).

Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you create or query data projections, Quasar will provide you with the tools to develop and maintain them and ultimately save you time.

## What are the prerequisites?

ðŸ›  Your project must be based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com) (version 8 or above), you must have a good understanding of the framework and especially [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent).

## When should I use it?

âœ… When you need an easy and fast API to build complex data like statistics, rates, aggregates or even time-series based on your Eloquent models.

## When should I not use it?

ðŸš« Can you solve your problem with a single SQL query? This might not be your case as you won't benefit from the package. The goal of Quasar is to provide help with complex data, allowing you to query it in a quick and easy way.

## What are the alternatives to Quasar?

ðŸ’Ž One of the alternatives to this package is [Laravel Event Sourcing](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-event-sourcing) built by [Spatie](https://spatie.be), but keep in mind that it provides a low-level API to implement projections without time-series, you'll have to build them by yourself.

ðŸ“Š On the other hand if you are only looking for a tool to convert your data into a chart, then I advise you to look at the [Charts](https://github.com/Chartisan/Charts) package.

## How to get started?

ðŸ†• If you want to discover the library, I advise you to follow the [Quickstart section](/quickstart).

If you are already familiar with the library, the [next](/getting-started/installation) section will guide you through the installation process.
