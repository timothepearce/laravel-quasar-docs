# What is Quasar?

The name "Quasar" refers to the celestial body of the same name that radiates from the center of galaxies and absorbs an immense amount of matter.

Quasar aims to provide a simple and understandable interface for developers to create and maintain data projections from Eloquent models easily.

One of the typical use cases solved by Quasar is the creation of statistical data represented as a time series. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you need to create or write a query for these data projections, Quasar will provide you with the tools to develop and maintain them and ultimately save you time.
