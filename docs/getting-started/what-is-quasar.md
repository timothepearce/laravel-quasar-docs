# What is Quasar?

:::info

Laravel Quasar is in pre-release, feel free to star or contribute if you find interest in this project!

:::

Laravel Quasar aims to provide a simple and understandable interface for developers to create and maintain **data projections** from **Eloquent models** easily.

The name "Quasar" refers to the celestial body of the same name that radiates from the center of galaxies, absorbs an immense amount of matter and distorts the space-time. Well, consider it as a metaphor of what it can do ðŸ˜„!

## What can it do?

âœ¨ One of the typical use cases solved by Laravel Quasar is the creation and maintenance of statistical data represented as **time series** (aka your statistic dashboard).

Instead of reinventing the wheel every time you create or query data projections, Quasar will provide you with the tools to develop and maintain them and ultimately save you time.

## What are the prerequisites?

ðŸ›  Your project must be based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com) (version 8 or above), you must have a good understanding of the framework and especially [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent).

## When should I use it?

âœ… When you need an easy and fast API to build complex data like statistics, rates, aggregates or even time-series based on your Eloquent models.

## When should I not use it?

ðŸš« Can you solve your problem with a single SQL query? Well, don't go for it! The Goal of Quasar is to help you with complexes data you want a final view at it quickly!

## How to get started?

If you want to discover the library, I advise you to follow the [Quickstart section](/quickstart).

If you are already familiar with the library, the [next](/getting-started/installation) section will guide you through the installation process.
